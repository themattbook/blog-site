	<h2><a href="https://www.dfnfreight.com/">DFN Freight Network</a></h2>
	<p>
		My most recent work was with DFN Freight Network, a Canadian digital
		freight broker. There&apos;s a lot to moving freight from one place to
		another and this was quite a learning experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		So you need a truck? What kind of truck? Does it need to be a large
		truck, a small truck, refrigerated (called a "reefer" truck), not
		reefer? So many questions, so little time. Once you&apos;ve figured out
		the kind of truck you need, it&apos;s time to find a freight broker.
		They&apos;re the folks who handle the topics such as "how much?" and
		"who gets to bid?" - after which, a carrier company bids on the load.
	</p>
	<p>
		DFNX takes the middle-man out of the equation and gives both carriers
		and shippers complete oversight regarding the shipment.
	</p>
	<p>
		We elected to use Vue 3, Pinia, TypeScript, and a custom backend in
		Next.js/Prisma. I worked with a Figma render and did my best to develop
		as much as I could. I had a lot to learn on this project and my CTO was
		incredibly patient with me. Vue 3 is an incredible framework.
	</p>
	<h3>Tornado Trax</h3>
	<p>
		Suffice it to say, I&apos;m a big meteorology nerd. I frappin' love
		tornadoes. No, not their destruction and no, not the trauma they have
		been known to cause, but the event itself. I love learning about how
		tornadoes work; their mystery, the different shapes and sizes, all of
		it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I created an application that allows you, the user, to select a year and
		a state. From there,
		<a href="https://tornadotrax.vercel.app/" target="_blank">
			Tornado Trax
		</a>
		will show you the complete path of the tornado superimposed on a map.
		The tracks are color-coded by severity and clicking on one reveals a
		popup with information about the tornado. Written in Vue 3 and riddled
		with Tailwindcss bugs, I&apos; planning to move it to React and use Sass
		for styling.
	</p>
	<h3>Codename: Uproar</h3>
	<p>
		As a co-owner of OpenTeknik, the company behind Open Source Social
		Network, I set out on ways to add more products to our portfolio. One of
		the ideas I had was a Javascript take on social media. Since we are a
		social media company, I wanted to diversify the experience by lending
		something that was built on Javascript instead of PHP and took on a more
		Twitter-esque vibe over Facebook. It&apos;s called
		<a href="https://social-network-beta-snowy.vercel.app/" target="_blank">
			Uproar
		</a>
		for now, but that name will likely change in the future.
